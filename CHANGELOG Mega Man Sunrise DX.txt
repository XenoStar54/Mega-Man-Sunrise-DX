This mod seeks to improve certain unpolished elements of the original Mega Man Sunrise and generally smooth over the game without fundamentally changing anything about the identity of the game.
This mostly comes in the form of level design tweaks and edits that make the game more approachable and fair.
Adds a bit of extra content. Some side rooms have been added, some challenges for collectibles changed, and Sunrise Tokens have been added in secret areas to contribute towards a true ending.
Mod by XenoStar54, original game by DJCoco.

**Currently Known Issues**

- Game has a bad habit of softlocking if left alone too long, but this is a quality of the original that would be nearly impossible for me to fix unless I knew the exact source.

**Changes**

*Title Screen*

- Game now starts with the grid off by default.

*Stage Select / Other Menus*

- Game saves progress between Wily stages. The player no longer has to complete them all in one go.

*Enemy Changes*

- Invincibility frames have been entirely removed from enemies.
- Mets now have more of a delay to firing, allowing MM to shoot them preemptively as is possible in all official Mega Man games.
- Armaroid shots are now destructible, as they were in MMV.
- Popo Helis now behave as they did in MM9, firing a single burst of flame and then flying directly upwards off of the screen. HP reduced from 3 to 1 as well.
- Sakrets' HP has been lowered from 5 to 3, as in MM9.
- Lowered the speed of Screw Bomber projectiles to a more manageable speed.

*Boss Changes*

- All bosses' contact damage was slightly reduced.
- Weakness order now broken into two chains that are self-contained between the two parts of the game: Vine > Circuit > Valve > Scorch and Kunai > Sound > Haze > Mirage. Secondary weaknesses shuffled slightly but mostly kept the same.
- Boss contact damage universally lowered slightly.
- Vine Man now moves marginally slower on the ground (1.25 -> 1).
- Valve Man now moves marginally slower on the ground (1.25 -> 1).

*Weapon Changes*

- Universally cut lag on all weapon firing. Only certain weapons now have cooldown timers (Vine Whip and Sound Dash).
- Universally changed all non-immune weapons to deal 1 damage to bosses, 2 if a semi-weakness, and 3 if a weakness.
- Mega Buster now does 1 damage instead of 0.5.
- Valve Missile moves slightly faster and costs less weapon energy (2 -> 1).
- Circuit Breaker made slighly faster.
- Kunai Blade made slightly faster and slightly more powerful. 5 should be able to be onscreen at once rather than 3. Ammo consumption upped very slightly (0.1 -> 0.25).
- Mirage Bomb ammo cost lowered marginally (2.5 -> 2).
- Haze Shield ammo cost lowered marginally (3.5 -> 3).
- Trance Wrecker slightly nerfed by increasing its energy cost (1 -> 1.5).

*Vine Man Stage*

- First E-Tank room completely redesigned to be remotely interesting.

*Scorch Man Stage*

- Some rooms rearranged a bit. Pointless unbreakable barrier room redone to make more sense.

*Circuit Man Stage*

- Ice added to one certain platform in the stage that lacked it for some strange reason.
- Weapon energy removed from the sliding E-Tank pickup area, as this immediately softlocks you if you try to fill a weapon up.

*Kunai Man Stage*

- Added checkpoint where one was originally absent right before the boss room.

*Haze Man Stage*

- Altered several segments to be less player-hostile.

*Wily Stage 1*

- Fixed a graphical issue with a couple of tiles in the room with the Suzies where certain solid-looking tiles have no collision. 
- Removed several cheap spots from the stage.
- Urchin Attacker's vulnerable spot is now easier to hit.

*Wily Stage 3*

- Added a sunrise near the end of the stage for thematic effect.

*Wily Stage 4*

- Made the first final boss cutscene skippable.
- TBD MAKE SECOND ONE SKIPPABLE

**Content Additions**

- Sunrise Tokens added in secret areas in each of the eight robot master stages.
